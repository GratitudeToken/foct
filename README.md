It gets interesting when you apply moving CSS gradient backgrounds to different parts of the UI, like for buttons, icons, text, backgrounds or to the entire viewport.

I noticed some really cool visual effects in my experimentation.

The sky is the limit.


**TO DO:**

- Implement a simple brush script that allows you to draw/brush over the screen and use that drawing instead of the default.

- Different effect examples for buttons, icons, text, backgrounds or entire viewports of different websites (starting with google.com).
